#
# End-to-end BFB regression test for the dual-map CAAS path.
#
# Step 1: serially compute lo/hi weight maps online and persist them via
#         iMOAB_WriteMapFile (--compute_online --write_maps); also write
#         the serial baseline digests for the lo/hi/dual projections.
#
# Step 2: re-run at N=1, 2, 4 (configurable) loading those same map files
#         from disk and writing per-cell digests. Loading from disk gives
#         a byte-identical input matrix on every rank; coupled with the
#         partition-invariant source field on the on-disk ATM mesh, the
#         per-cell projected values must be byte-identical across rank
#         counts.
#
# Step 3: cmp -s every {kernel}_<n>.txt against {kernel}_1.txt. Any byte
#         difference is a regression. Exit code 0 iff all pairs match.
#
# Usage:
#   imoab_dualmap_caas_bfb.sh <path-to-imoab_dualmap_caas-binary> [N1 N2 ...]
# Default rank counts: 1 2 4

# Required environment: mpirun on PATH, write access to a working dir.
